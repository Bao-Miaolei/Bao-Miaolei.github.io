					You might also talk about groups that you have worked with (and perhaps link to them), and/or put your interests here!

			                <p> I graduated with a Masterâ€™s in Biostatistics from the University of Washington. I am working part-time at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center on analyzing PrEP adherence patterns from <a href="https://www.hptn.org/research/studies/hptn-082">  the HPTN 082 clinical trial</a>. In my capstone project, I worked with Electronic Health Records to evaluate the superiority of pharmacist-led diabetes control. Previously, I utilized <a href="https://github.com/Bao-Miaolei/X-Ray-Classification">  machine learning prediction models </a> using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify thorax diseases using chest X-rays and developed a package to implement <a href="https://github.com/Bao-Miaolei/KDE_spherical">  kernel density estimation with spherical data</a>. I have experience in statistical modeling, longitudinal data, survival analysis, nonparametric analysis, electronic medical records, and clinical trials.</p>
			
					<p> I am broadly interested in Biostatistics and Data Science, and enjoy the process of engaging domain science, statistical models and programmatic data analysis.</p>

		<strong>Valley View Health Center, Capstone Project</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Cleaned and standardized 38,000+ Electronic Health Records (EHRs) collected across 11 health center sites, imputed 10% missing data and performed quality checks, ensuring high data quality and readiness for statistical analysis. </li>
		<li> Designed and implemented statistical analysis plans in R, utilizing linear mixed effect models, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazards models to assess the effectiveness of a pharmacist-led intervention for diabetes management. </li>
		<li> Conducted meetings with medical professionals, translating statistical findings into clinical insights in non-technical language. </li> 
		</ul>
		<strong><a href = "https://github.com/Bao-Miaolei/DHS">Health Metrics Prediction Using Demographic and Health Surveys</a></strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Built pipelines to automate the extraction and modification of 4,000+ survey metric preprocessing functions using Python. </li>
		<li> Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) to match function labels with corresponding formal variable descriptions. </li> 
		<li> Wrote documentation and applied Bayesian hierarchical models in R to generate national and regional estimates. </li> 
		<li> Contributed to an R package, assisted in resolving identified technical issues, prepared reports and created various visualizations for group meetings with academic collaborators, government representatives, and United Nations experts. </li>
		</ul>
		<strong><a href = "https://github.com/Bao-Miaolei/X-Ray-Classification">Thorax Disease Prediction via Machine Learning-based X-ray Classification</a></strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Developed prediction models using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify thorax diseases using chest X-ray data from over 5,600 images, employed F1 score to ensure robustness, and achieved an accuracy of 93.3%. </li>
		<li> Utilized TensorFlow and Keras for model architecture development, applied dropout techniques to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization, and optimized hyperparameters such as batch sizes for high-dimensional image data. </li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Analysis of Factors Influencing Corporate Environment Disclosure Quality</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Cleaned over 20,000 corporate records from the CSMAR databases, calculated descriptive statistics and correlation. </li>
		<li> Adopted stepwise variable selection, and performed multivariate regression analysis to identify key patterns using SAS.</li>
		<li> Identified factors related to Environment Disclosure Quality, including corporate financial leverage and firm value, providing insights into financial performance.</li>
		</ul>
