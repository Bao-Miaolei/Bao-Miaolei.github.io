			                <p> I'm a Master's Student in Biostatistics at the University of Washington. I am working part-time at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center on analyzing PrEP adherence patterns from <a href="https://www.hptn.org/research/studies/hptn-082">  the HPTN 082 clinical trial</a>. Previously, I utilized <a href="https://github.com/Bao-Miaolei/X-Ray-Classification">  machine learning prediction models </a> using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify thorax diseases using chest X-rays and developed a package to implement <a href="https://github.com/Bao-Miaolei/KDE_spherical">  kernel density estimation with spherical data</a>. I have experience in statistical modeling, longitudinal data, nonparametric analysis, electronic medical records, and clinical trials.</p>
			
					<p> I am broadly interested in Biostatistics and Data Science, and enjoy the process of engaging domain science, statistical models and programmatic data analysis.</p>

		<strong>Valley View Health Center, Capstone Project</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Processed electronic health records from multiple health center sites, ensuring high data quality and readiness. </li>
		<li> Developed and executed statistical analysis plans using R, applied linear mixed-effects models and survival analysis techniques to test the pharmacist-led interventionâ€™s superiority, and handled missing data. </li>
		<li> Conducted regular meetings with the medical professional sponsor, providing updates in concise and non-technical terms. </li> 
		</ul>
		<strong><a href = "https://github.com/Bao-Miaolei/DHS">Health Metrics Prediction Using Demographic and Health Surveys</a></strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Automated code extraction and preprocessing from GitHub utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python for 4000+ metrics, wrote documentations, and applied Bayesian models in R to generate national and regional estimates. </li>
		<li> Prepared written reports and created various visualizations for group meetings with academic collaborators, government representatives, and United Nations experts, facilitating data-driven decision-making on public health priorities.</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Drug Adherence Analysis, Fred Hutch Cancer Center</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Cleaned data from large-scale datasets using R, conducted in-depth data analyses using exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling (logistic regression), and hypothesis testing (t tests and chi-square tests), identifying adherence patterns and trends. </li>
		<li> Collaborated with cross-functional teams, fulfilled ad-hoc data requests, developed reports, graphs, and tables to display and communicate results, and regularly presented findings to senior investigators and prepared for publications.</li>
		</ul>
		<strong><a href = "https://github.com/Bao-Miaolei/X-Ray-Classification">Thorax Disease Prediction via Machine Learning-based X-ray Classification</a></strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Developed prediction models using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify thorax diseases using chest X-ray data from over 5,600 images, employed F1 score to ensure robustness, and achieved an accuracy of 93.3%. </li>
		<li> Utilized TensorFlow and Keras for model architecture development, applied dropout techniques to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization, and optimized hyperparameters such as batch sizes for high-dimensional image data. </li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Analysis of Factors Influencing Corporate Environment Disclosure Quality</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> Cleaned over 20,000 corporate records from the CSMAR databases, calculated descriptive statistics and correlation. </li>
		<li> Adopted stepwise variable selection, and performed multivariate regression analysis to identify key patterns using SAS.</li>
		<li> Identified factors related to Environment Disclosure Quality, including corporate financial leverage and firm value, providing insights into financial performance.</li>
